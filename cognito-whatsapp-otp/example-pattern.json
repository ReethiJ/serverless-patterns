      "By default, Amazon Cognito uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) for delivery of SMS text messages.",
      "This can be changed with the help of custom SMS sender Lambda trigger. When you assign a custom SMS sender trigger to your user pool, Amazon Cognito invokes a Lambda function instead of its default behavior when a user event requires that it send an SMS message. ",
      "The AWS Lambda function can then send SMS notifications to your users through a method and provider that you choose. This pattern will provide guidance on how to use custom sender lambda triggers to send OTP messages on WhatsApp."
